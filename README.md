Quick Clinic is a web project that is made for e-channeling Using PHP, SQL, HTML
& CSS. This initiative facilitates online appointment requests for clients or patients of
medical establishments, including clinics and hospitals. This project can also help
doctors to manage their appointment with their patients. This doctor's appointment
system will organize the schedules of each patient's appointment, which will be
submitted as a request to the doctor they have selected. The system comprises three key
roles: administrator, doctor, and patient. The system admin will populate the list of the
doctors with their specialties and along with the doctor's details and system credentials.
The patients can browse the Quick Clinic website to find a doctor that
has the specialty of their needs. Patients can review the doctor's weekly schedule,
enabling them to select a suitable day and time for their appointment. Subsequently,
they can submit their appointment request. After that, the doctors can view all their
appointments and the appointment request of the patients for their availability.
